 *
 * A snapshot selection range defined by two grid references that identifies
 * a contiguous or rectangular region of terminal content.
 *
 * The start and end values are GhosttyGridRef values. They are therefore
 * untracked grid references and inherit the same lifetime rules: they are
 * only safe to use until the next mutating operation on the terminal that
 * produced them, including freeing the terminal. To keep a selection valid
 * across terminal mutations, callers must maintain tracked grid references
 * for the endpoints and reconstruct a GhosttySelection from fresh snapshots
 * when needed.
