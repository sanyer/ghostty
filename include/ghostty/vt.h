// Allocator Interface

/**
 * Function table for custom memory allocator operations.
 * 
 * This vtable defines the interface for a custom memory allocator. All
 * function pointers must be valid and non-NULL.
 *
 * If you're not going to use a custom allocator, you can ignore all of
 * this. All functions that take an allocator pointer allow NULL to use a
 * default allocator.
 *
 * The interface is based on the Zig allocator interface. I'll say up front
 * that it is easy to look at this interface and think "wow, this is really
 * overcomplicated". The reason for this complexity is well thought out by
 * the Zig folks, and it enables a diverse set of allocation strategies
 * as shown by the Zig ecosystem. As a consolation, please note that many
 * of the arguments are only needed for advanced use cases and can be
 * safely ignored in simple implementations. For example, if you look at 
 * the Zig implementation of the libc allocator in `lib/std/heap.zig`
 * (search for CAllocator), you'll see it is very simple.
 *
 * We chose to align with the Zig allocator interface because:
 *
 *   1. It is a proven interface that serves a wide variety of use cases
 *      in the real world via the Zig ecosystem. It's shown to work.
 *
 *   2. Our core implementation itself is Zig, and this lets us very
 *      cheaply and easily convert between C and Zig allocators.
 *
 * NOTE(mitchellh): In the future, we can have default implementations of
 * resize/remap and allow those to be null.
